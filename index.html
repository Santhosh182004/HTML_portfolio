        <h2 style="font-size: medium;"> About me:</h2>
        <article>
           Hello! I’m Santhosh Senthilkumar from Erode, Tamil Nadu. I’ve completed my B.E. in Electrical and Electronics Engineering from Nandha Engineering College.
Though my core background is in Embedded Systems and Power Electronics, my passion for IT and software development grew stronger during my academic journey. 
I’ve built skills in Core Java (OOPs, Collections, Multithreading), SQL (Queries, Joins), HTML, CSS, and Power BI. I also completed a 21-Day Java Full Stack Development training conducted by Brainovision Pvt Ltd.
I believe in continuous learning and adaptability. My curiosity led me to explore programming, databases, and problem-solving even from a non-IT 
background. Apart from academics, I’ve actively contributed as the Associate Library Secretary and a member of the Tree Plantation and Fine Arts Clubs,
 where I developed my leadership and teamwork skills.
My Short-term Goal: Upskill myself and contribute effectively in development, testing, or support roles at a reputed IT firm.
My Long-term Goal: Master emerging technologies and grow into a leadership position within the tech industry.
I admire Jackie Chan for his dedication and Ratan Tata for his service-driven mindset. I strive to bring dedication, responsibility, and humility
 into my work and life.
 "Even though I may not know everything, I never hesitate to explore, learn, and grow."
